# 📧 Spam Detection Using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based spam detection system built using Python and developed in Google Colab. It classifies messages as spam or not spam using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms.
This project demonstrates a simple and effective **spam message classifier** using **Python**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Machine Learning**. It predicts whether a given message is **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on its content.

Built using **Google Colab**, this project leverages NLP techniques for text preprocessing and applies the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm for classification.
